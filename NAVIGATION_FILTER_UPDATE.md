# Navigation Filter Update

## Changes Made

### Overview
Modified the home page navigation items under "Sayfa Türleri" (Page Types) to provide quick filtering functionality instead of redirecting to the pages route.

### Files Modified

1. **`src/app/page.tsx`**
   - Replaced direct navigation cards with new `HomePageContent` component
   - Removed unused imports (Card, CardContent, icons)
   - Simplified the page structure

2. **`src/components/home/home-page-content.tsx`** (New File)
   - Created interactive navigation buttons for page types
   - Added visual feedback for selected filters
   - Implemented filter state management
   - Added accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
   - Added filter indicator with result count

3. **`src/components/home/published-pages-section.tsx`**
   - Added props for external filter control
   - Synchronized internal filters with parent component
   - Added callback for filtered result count
   - Enhanced filter clearing functionality

### Features Added

#### Interactive Navigation
- **Click to Filter**: Navigation cards now filter pages instantly on the home page
- **Visual Feedback**: Selected filters are highlighted with color-coded styling
- **Filter Indicator**: Shows active filter with result count
- **Quick Clear**: Easy filter clearing with dedicated button

#### Enhanced User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated state changes
- **Color Coding**: Each page type has distinct colors:
  - Bilgi (Info): Blue
  - Prosedür (Procedure): Green
  - Duyuru (Announcement): Yellow
  - Uyarı (Warning): Red

#### Accessibility
- ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus indicators
- Semantic button elements

### How It Works

1. **Initial Load**: Shows all published pages
2. **Filter Selection**: Click any page type card to filter results
3. **Real-time Updates**: Pages update immediately without page reload
4. **Filter Sync**: Advanced filters in the pages section stay synchronized
5. **Clear Filters**: Click "Temizle" to show all pages again

### Technical Implementation

- Uses React state management for filter synchronization
- Leverages existing API endpoints for filtering
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing functionality
- No breaking changes to existing components

### Benefits

- **Faster Navigation**: No page reloads for filtering
- **Better UX**: Immediate visual feedback
- **Improved Accessibility**: Full keyboard and screen reader support
- **Consistent Design**: Maintains existing visual language
- **Performance**: Efficient state management and API calls
