# User Management System

This document describes the user management functionality implemented for administrators in the Verida Corporate Information Application.

## Overview

The user management system allows administrators to:
- View and search all users in the system
- Create new users with appropriate roles
- Modify user roles and permissions
- Deactivate/delete users when necessary
- Monitor user activity and statistics

## Access Control

### Who Can Access User Management

- **System Administrators**: Full access to all user management features
- **Administrators**: Can manage Editors and Members, but not other Admins or System Administrators
- **Editors**: No access to user management
- **Members**: No access to user management

### Permission Matrix

| Action | System Admin | Admin | Editor | Member |
|--------|--------------|-------|--------|--------|
| View user list | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Create users | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Edit user roles | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ* | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Delete users | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ* | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Assign System Admin role | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |
| Assign Admin role | ‚úÖ | ‚ùå | ‚ùå | ‚ùå |

*Admins can only modify Editors and Members, not other Admins or System Administrators.

## Features

### 1. User Dashboard (`/admin/users`)

The main user management interface provides:

- **User List**: Paginated table showing all users with their details
- **Search**: Find users by name or email
- **Role Filter**: Filter users by their assigned role
- **User Statistics**: Shows page count and comment count for each user
- **Status Indicators**: Shows if user email is verified

### 2. User Creation

Administrators can create new users with:

- **Email Validation**: Must be @dgmgumruk.com domain
- **Name Requirement**: Full name is required
- **Role Assignment**: Choose appropriate role based on permissions
- **Auto-verification**: Admin-created users are automatically email-verified

### 3. Role Management

- **Role Assignment**: Change user roles with appropriate permission checks
- **Role Descriptions**: Clear descriptions of what each role can do
- **Permission Validation**: System prevents unauthorized role assignments
- **Activity Logging**: All role changes are logged for audit purposes

### 4. User Deactivation/Deletion

- **Safe Deletion**: Prevents self-deletion and unauthorized deletions
- **Confirmation**: Requires confirmation before permanent deletion
- **Cascade Handling**: Related data is handled appropriately
- **Activity Logging**: Deletion actions are logged

## User Interface Components

### Main Components

1. **UserManagementDashboard**: Main container component
2. **UserList**: Displays paginated user table
3. **UserInviteForm**: Modal for creating new users
4. **UserRoleManager**: Modal for changing user roles

### Key Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Real-time Updates**: Interface updates after user actions
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and validation
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during operations

## API Endpoints

### User Management APIs

- `GET /api/users` - List users with pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/users` - Create new user (Admin only)
- `GET /api/users/[id]` - Get specific user details
- `PUT /api/users/[id]` - Update user information
- `DELETE /api/users/[id]` - Delete user (Admin only)
- `PUT /api/users/[id]/role` - Update user role (Admin only)

### Request/Response Examples

#### Create User
```json
POST /api/users
{
  "email": "newuser@dgmgumruk.com",
  "name": "New User",
  "role": "MEMBER"
}
```

#### Update Role
```json
PUT /api/users/user-id/role
{
  "role": "EDITOR"
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role-based access control enforced at API level
- Middleware validates user permissions before operations
- Self-modification prevention (users can't modify their own roles/delete themselves)

### Input Validation

- Email domain restriction (@dgmgumruk.com only)
- Zod schema validation for all inputs
- SQL injection prevention through Prisma ORM
- XSS protection through input sanitization

### Activity Logging

All user management actions are logged including:
- User creation by administrators
- Role changes with before/after values
- User deletions
- Failed permission attempts

## Navigation

User management is accessible through:

- **Desktop**: Header navigation "Kullanƒ±cƒ± Y√∂netimi" link (üë• icon)
- **Mobile**: Mobile menu "Kullanƒ±cƒ± Y√∂netimi" option
- **Direct URL**: `/admin/users`

## Error Handling

The system provides clear error messages for:

- **Permission Denied**: When user lacks required permissions
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid email domains, missing required fields
- **Conflict Errors**: Attempting to create users with existing emails
- **Network Errors**: API communication failures

## Testing

User management functionality is tested through:

- **Unit Tests**: Role validation, permission checks, email validation
- **Integration Tests**: API endpoint testing
- **Manual Testing**: UI component functionality

Run tests with:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/tests/test-user-management.ts
```

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the user management system:

1. **Bulk Operations**: Select and modify multiple users at once
2. **User Import**: CSV import for bulk user creation
3. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by creation date, last login, etc.
4. **User Profiles**: Extended user information and preferences
5. **Audit Trail**: Detailed history of all user changes
6. **Email Notifications**: Notify users when their roles change

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Can't see user management menu**: Check if user has Admin or System Admin role
2. **Permission denied errors**: Verify user role and target user role compatibility
3. **Email validation fails**: Ensure email ends with @dgmgumruk.com
4. **Can't delete user**: Check if trying to delete self or higher-privileged user

### Support

For technical support or questions about user management:
1. Check the activity logs for detailed error information
2. Verify user permissions and role assignments
3. Review the API response messages for specific error details
